//this code is used and implemented by seeing a udemy video of javascript
console.log("the first thing happen")
alert("its not going to move on")
console.log("the second thing is called after the alert is closed")
    //teh second segment of code is not going to run as the  js is single threaded and thats whay 
    //we developed the asynchronous . single threaded means that the javascript is doing 
    //one thng at a time
    //setTimeout(() => {
    //the javascript should onlu pay attention as it 
    // it knows when to work        
    //   }, timeout);
    /* 
    the futher reference is in notes of we development
     */
    //the main relative disadvantage is the nesting of callbacks
