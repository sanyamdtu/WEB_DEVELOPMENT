     It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.
However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section is what is
important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first.
Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text

Use an inline style to try to make our h1 element white.
 Remember, in line styles look like this:

<h1 style="color: green;">

Leave the blue-text and pink-text classes on your h1 element.

id declarations override class declarations, regardless of where they are
declared in your style element CSS.

inline styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.
In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override 
your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has 
specific CSS, you can use !important

Let's go all the way back to our pink-text class declaration. Remember that 
our pink-text class was overridden by subsequent class declarations, 
id declarations, and inline styles.

Let's add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color 
declaration to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink.

An example of how to do this is:

color: red !important;

To create a CSS variable, you just need to give it a name with two hyphens 
in front of it and assign it a value like this:

--penguin-skin: gray;
This will create a variable named --penguin-skin and assign it the 
value of gray. Now you can use that variable elsewhere in your CSS to 
change the value of other elements to gray.


After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS 
properties by referencing the name you gave it.

background: var(--penguin-skin);
This will change the background of whatever element you are targeting 
to gray because that is the value of the --penguin-skin variable.
Note that styles will not be applied unless the variable names
are an exact match.
